Certainly! To achieve this, you can use the `smtplib` library to send emails and the `urllib.request` library to read the content of a URL. Here's an example Python code that demonstrates both functionalities:

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
import urllib.request

def send_email(subject, body, to_email):
    # Your email credentials
    sender_email = "your_email@gmail.com"
    sender_password = "your_email_password"

    # Setup the MIME
    message = MIMEMultipart()
    message["From"] = sender_email
    message["To"] = to_email
    message["Subject"] = subject

    # Attach the body to the email
    message.attach(MIMEText(body, "plain"))

    # Connect to the SMTP server (Gmail example)
    with smtplib.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com", 587) as server:
        server.starttls()  # Secure the connection
        server.login(sender_email, sender_password)
        server.sendmail(sender_email, to_email, message.as_string())

def read_url_content(url):
    # Read content from the URL
    with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as response:
        content = response.read()
        return content.decode("utf-8")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example usage
    email_subject = "Hello from Python!"
    email_body = "This is the content of the URL:\n\n"
    
    # Replace with the URL you want to read
    url_to_read = "https://www.example.com"

    # Read the content of the URL
    url_content = read_url_content(url_to_read)
    
    # Append URL content to email body
    email_body += url_content

    # Replace with the email address you want to send to
    recipient_email = "recipient@example.com"

    # Send the email
    send_email(email_subject, email_body, recipient_email)

    print("Email sent successfully!")
```

Make sure to replace placeholders such as `your_email@gmail.com`, `your_email_password`, `https://www.example.com`, and `recipient@example.com` with your actual email credentials, the URL you want to read, and the recipient's email address.

Note: Please be cautious with storing email credentials in your code, especially if you plan to share or publish the code. Consider using environment variables or other secure methods for handling sensitive information.
